## Obsrevations

Founds two interesting answers from model output:
1) For question "how to write resume for Data science position ?" <br>
--> It has written the answer specific to data science field.

2) For question "write python code to Combine two lists and remove duplicates without using set function" <br>
--> provided the code with no use of set() python code as expected.

## Future Work

- Fine tune the model with custom data for specific use case
- Improve accuracy
